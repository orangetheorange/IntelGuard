Report on Cybersecurity Scan Results - Localhost

Date: May 26th, 2025

We have completed a comprehensive security audit using Nmap version 7.95 on your local system (localhost), which identified no critical vulnerabilities. However, we recommend taking some preventive measures to ensure maximum protection against potential threats.

Summary:
The following services were found running on your machine during our test:

* MSRPC (TCP port 135)
* Microsoft-DS (TCP port 445)
* WSAPI (TCP port 5357)
* SDR (TCP port 9010)
* GLPRC (TCP port 9080)
* SNET Sensor Management (TCP port 10000)

No known vulnerabilities associated with these services were detected by this scan.

Solution & Prevention Measures:
To maintain optimal security levels, please consider implementing the following recommendations:

1. Keep all software updated: Ensure you regularly update your operating system as well as installed applications like antivirus programs, web browsers, etc., to benefit from latest patches addressing existing vulnerabilities.

2. Use strong passwords: Create complex, unique passwords for each account and avoid reusing them across different platforms. Consider enabling two-factor authentication wherever possible.

3. Limit access rights: Review user permissions and restrict unnecessary privileges where feasible to minimize unauthorized access risks.

4. Regularly monitor network activity: Implement monitoring tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS)/intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect any suspicious activities promptly.

5. Backup data frequently: Protect valuable information through regular backups stored securely offline or offsite. This will help recover lost files if needed.

Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that your local system (localhost) appears to be secure without significant vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, maintaining vigilance would be helpful.
